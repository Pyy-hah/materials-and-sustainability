    <h1>Comprehensive Life Cycle Analysis of Gym Vests</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>With the increasing awareness of sustainable development and environmental protection, the textile industry is also working to reduce its environmental impact. Some textile companies have begun to adopt more environmentally friendly production methods, such as using renewable energy, reducing the use of chemicals, and promoting circular economy. At the same time, some manufacturers are also promoting the use of organic cotton, recycled fibers and other environmentally friendly materials. The entire industry chain is working to reduce carbon emissions, reduce wastewater emissions, and improve resource efficiency to achieve sustainable development. The gym vests in this survey are usually made of high-stretch polyester fabrics, which have good elasticity and durability, and are easy to dye, so they are favored by consumers and producers.</p>

        <h2>Life Cycle Inventory</h2>
        <h3>Table A.1: Life cycle inventory in cases with 200 uses (S1, S4, S5, S7 and S8). Values are halved when T-shirt is used for 400 times (S2 and S3). For use times, a data quality index of 3 was used.</h3>

        <h2>Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Raw Material Purchase:</strong> Look for sustainable and environmentally friendly polyester fabric suppliers, such as recycled polyester or using renewable materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing Process:</strong> Optimize production processes to reduce energy consumption and waste emissions. Use environmentally friendly technologies and equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Design:</strong> Extend product life by designing vests that are durable, easy to maintain and repair. Consider designing modularity for easy part replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Packaging and Transportation:</strong> Choose degradable or recyclable packaging materials. Optimize transportation methods to reduce carbon emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Stage:</strong> Promote correct use and maintenance methods. Provide user cleaning and maintenance guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Decommissioning and Recycling:</strong> Increase recycling rate by designing easy-to-recycle products. Promote the concept of recycling to transform discarded vests into new raw materials or products.</li>
